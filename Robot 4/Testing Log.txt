Completed "Complete Calibraton" (Press and hold both left and right button)

Tested BrainInertial for any flaws; no noticeable flaws

Tested heading for accuracy; ± 2 degrees for turn

Attempted to turn 90 DEGREES, ended 130 (±10) degrees

Attempting to decrease refresh rate to determine flaw; EBD*

Noticed that maxSpeed is set to 50 and the robot is turning faster than usual; testing in console

motor speed did not exceed max speed in testing

line 306 of version 00054c is debug information: print turnspeed into console after capping the motorspeed


ebd for refresh rate cont'd: attemped to reduce refresh rate (currently 20ms or 50hz) due to the rate of change being too high; decreased to 10 ms or 100 hz to see change.

same result; conclusion intertial fault or exit statement fault.

testing exit statement fault for threshold: currently set to 5.

Printing turnspeed into console to see result

during this test the robot overshot by 120 degrees ±10

printing every variable into console to see change (version 00055)

robot oscillated violently during testing: noticed that some text in console may have overlapped each other so refresh rate is too fast or due to the fact of the controller not being able to receive
						which both has affect with refresh rate

						also noticed noticed that derivative may not be functioning properly: set to 0 when not supposed to be

snapshot of console output (native) depicting all described above

although the refresh rate might be too slow because the highest derivative is 36.0 from a change from 29 to -7 where integral does not get a chance to refresh;


attempt to fix: make refresh rate faster and see what happens. 

new refresh rate 1ms (1000hz) to see affects.

console completely messed up and robot performance unaffected.

conclusion: canoot be refresh rate problem.


in version 00056, changed resetPosition() to setRotation(0, degrees)
no difference whatsoever;


attempted to set kp to 0.001 to find causes:

Cause was integral buildup: highest point 2000 
integral could not be reset due to the fact seen above: "although the refresh rate might be too slow because the highest derivative is 36.0 from a change from 29 to -7 where integral does not get a chance to refresh;";


slowed down (max speed 10): more accurate.

solution: use motor encoders as a backup system


distance from opp. wheels: 10 inches; 

distance each encoder has to travel = pi * 10 * angle / 360 * 360 / 7.84 / 3

simplified to  pi * angle / 60



Added aligment mech;

Center of gravity is moved towards the left; solutions: slow right down (front right, front left) or tune pid perfectly

solution1 attempt:

decrese by 20% (net 0.8)
still curved towards left

decrease by 50% net 0.5
still curved but less

decrease by 80% net 0.2
